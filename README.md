# What do the HTTP Status Codes represent?

### An HTTP status code is a message a website’s server sends to the browser to indicate whether or not that request can be fulfilled. Status codes specs are set by the W3C. Status codes are embedded in the HTTP header of a page to tell the browser the result of its request.

# What are the Primary HTTP Verbs and what do they mean?
### In HTTP’s terms, verbs are called “request methods”, and they determine how the server should respond to a particular request. They mean that, if a URL defines a resource (a blog post, for example, or an image), different actions can be performed on that resource without needing to create different URLs or pass different types of request data.
